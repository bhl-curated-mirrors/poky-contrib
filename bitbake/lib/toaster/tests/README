= Toaster tests =

== Host requirements ==

All the test components REQUIRE bash as your default shell, you
need to review if /bin/sh points to bash because some problems are
detected when use dash.

=== Toaster ===

- virtualenv for python
- pip for python

=== Toaster UI ===

- firefox web browser for use selenium
- firefox selenium addon, for install download latest from [1].
- vncserver (optional)

[1] http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/

=== Debian INSTALL ===

# apt-get install iceweasel python-virtualenv python-pip

Optional:

# apt-get install vnc4server

== Setup ==

For run any of the tests scripts you need to setup virtualenv and install
requirements with pip.

$ cd /home/user/pokydir
$ source oe-init-build-env build
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r toaster-requirements.txt
$ pip install -r toaster-tests-requirements.txt

== Toaster test ==

For run toaster you need to start a toaster instance and then use toaster-test
program, it can take sometime because it setup a toaster instance and run
testsuite over it.

For start/stop a toaster instance a helper exists and need to be called with
the path to the poky directory.

$ cd /home/user/pokydir
$ source oe-init-build-env build
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ ../bitbake/lib/toaster/tests/helpers.py -a start -d /home/user/pokydir -b build
$ toaster-test --run-all-tests
$ ../bitbake/lib/toaster/tests/helpers.py -a stop -d /home/user/pokydir -b build

Optional: Toaster test suite uses selenium and spawn Firefox web browser for
run the tests, if you are in a development machine may be is a good idea to
start vncserver and set DISPLAY before run to don't interfer with your tasks,
example:

$ vncserver :10
$ export DISPLAY=:10
