This layer is intended as test layer, used by image_tests to issue
runtime performance testing. It's probably a mistake to include it
in your builds (unless you want to run these tests).

Phoronix is to be used in the runtime performance testcases. As part
of Phoronix setup, the proxies need to be configured in the target
via the command 'phoronix-test-suite network-setup'. It is intended
to make this an automatic task in the future.

This is a skeleton layer at the moment, only containing the phoronix
dependency with meta-oe layer. It should be updated as soon as
testcases are defined for this component.
