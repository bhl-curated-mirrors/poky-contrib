About
=====
The Yocto + SPDX Project is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project 
built from Yocto, FOSSology and SPDX project. The goals are integrating Real-time 
license scanning, generating SPDX standard output and verifiying license info 
during the building process. Existing module includes scanning patched package, 
creating SPDX.out file. 
In addition to this document there is much more

Download the source from its branch:
git clone git clone git@git.yoctoproject.org:poky-contrib/spdx

Installation
============
1. Deploy Yocto + SPDX source
   Deploy SPDX.bbclass to ./meta/classes/

2. Plugin do_SPDX task
   add the following line to ./build/conf/local.conf
   INHERIT += "SPDX"

Execution
============
1. Using the following command to check if do_SPDX task is plugin
   bitbake -c listtasks <<target-name>> 
   For example: bitbake -c listtasks core-image-minimal 
   "do_SPDX" is supposed to be listed.
2. Execute the task
   bitbake <<target-name>>
   For example: bitbake core-image-minimal

Because the process will take a long time(especially during the first run), 
if you don't want to keep your console open or think it might run longer than 
you have your computer open run 
bitbake <<target-name>> >> logfile 2>&1 &
bitbake core-image-minimal >> /home/yocto/logfile.log 2>&1 &
