## Toaster automation scripts

Running build tests for toaster test suit-2 which used to publish on testopia.

These scripts are to test successful run of toaster module on released build and the result will be displayed on terminal and log will get created in folder 'toaster'.

Your oe build environment must be sourced/initialised for these tests to run.

# The simplest way to run the tests are:

1) Do source oe-init-build-env from poky and make sure toaster can run in that system, means toaster perquisite has been met and Chrome driver and selenium must be installed in host system.

2) Build following in toaster GUI first so that test scripts will take less time and and run effectively.

	core-image-base
	core-image-clutter
	core-image-minimal
	core-image-sato
	meta-ide-support
	meta-toolchain

 After that stop or kill the toaster:

	. toaster stop

3) Toaster functional test case part-2 include total 50+ test cases so it has been divided into four parts for better stability and testing.

4) Run below command from location "/bitbake/lib/toaster/tests/functional" one by one replacing * with [1,4]

	DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='toastermain.settings_test' ./manage.py test tests.functional.test_functional_basic_*


# Limitations:

This script must need optimization that will resolve stability issues.

These scripts are developed and tested on google chrome.
