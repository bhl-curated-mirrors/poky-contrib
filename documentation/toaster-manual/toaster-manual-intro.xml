    <para>
        Toaster is a web interface to the Yocto Project's
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-system-term'>OpenEmbedded build system</ulink>.
        The interface enables you to configure and run your builds.
        Information about builds is collected and stored in a database.
        You can use Toaster to configure and start builds on multiple
        remote build servers.
    </para>

    <note>
        <para>
            This release of Toaster does allow you to configure and initiate
            builds.
            However, you cannot use Toaster to customize image recipes, which
            still must either be done by hand or through
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;/tools-resources/projects/hob'>Hob</ulink>.
            As Toaster matures, it eventually will equal and surpass Hob
            functionality, at which time Hob will be deprecated.
        </para>

        <para>
            For more information on Hob,
            see the

        <title>Toaster Features</title>

        <para>
            Toaster does mainly two things: it allows you to configure and run builds, and it provides
            extensive information about the build process.
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para id='toaster-build-features'><emphasis>Configure and run builds:</emphasis>
                    You can use the Toaster web interface to configure and start your builds.
                    Builds started via the Toaster web interface are organised into projects.
                    When you create a project, you will be asked to select a release, or version
                    of the build system you want to use for the project builds. As shipped,
                    Toaster supports Yocto Project releases 1.8 and beyond.</para>

                            interface at any time. Builds started from command line are
                            shown within a special Toaster project called "Command line

                    Toaster also records extensive information about your builds. Data

        <para>
            You can set Toaster up to run as a local instance or as a shared
            hosted service.
        </para>

        <para>
            When Toaster is set up as a local instance, all the components
            reside on a single build host.
            Fundamentally, a local instance of Toaster is suited for a single
            user developing on a single build host.

            Toaster as a hosted service is suited for multiple users
            developing across several build hosts.
            When Toaster is set up as a hosted service, its components can
            be spread across several machines:
