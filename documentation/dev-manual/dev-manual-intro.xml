<title>The Yocto Project Development Manual</title>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>
            Welcome to the Yocto Project Development Manual!
            This manual provides information on how to use the Yocto Project to
            develop embedded Linux images and user-space applications that
            run on targeted devices.
            The manual provides an overview of image, kernel, and
            user-space application development using the Yocto Project.
            Because much of the information in this manual is general, it
            contains many references to other sources where you can find more
            detail.
            For example, you can find detailed information on Git, repositories,
            and open source in general in many places on the Internet.
            Another example specific to the Yocto Project is how to quickly
            set up your host development system and build an image, which you
            find in the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;'>Yocto Project Quick Start</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The Yocto Project Development Manual does, however, provide
            guidance and examples on how to change the kernel source code,
            reconfigure the kernel, and develop an application using
            <filename>devtool</filename>.
        </para>

        <note>
            By default, using the Yocto Project creates a Poky distribution.
            However, you can create your own distribution by providing key
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#metadata'>Metadata</ulink>.
            A good example is Angstrom, which has had a distribution
            based on the Yocto Project since its inception.
            Other examples include commercial distributions like
            <ulink url='https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/wind-river-systems'>Wind River Linux</ulink>,
            <ulink url='https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/mentor-graphics'>Mentor Embedded Linux</ulink>,
            <ulink url='https://www.yoctoproject.org/organization/enea-ab'>ENEA Linux</ulink>
            and <ulink url='https://www.yoctoproject.org/ecosystem/member-organizations'>others</ulink>.

        <para>
            This manual will not give you the following:

                    manual contains detailed instructions on how to install an

                    This type of material resides in an appropriate reference manual.
