Contributions
============
Yocto + SPDX service privides the following contribution:
Real-time license scanning for patched components(By FOSSology)
Generating SPDX standard output
Verifiying license info among recipe, real-time scanning and archive during the building process.

Installation
============
1. Deploy Yocto + SPDX source
   Deploy SPDX.bbclass to ./meta/classes/

2. Plugin do_SPDX task
   add the following line to ./build/conf/local.conf
   INHERIT += "SPDX"

Execution
============
1. Using the following command to check if do_SPDX task is plugin
   bitbake -c listtasks <<target-name>> 
   For example: bitbake -c listtasks core-image-minimal 
   "do_SPDX" is supposed to be listed.
2. Execute the task
   bitbake <<target-name>>
   For example: bitbake core-image-minimal

Because the process will take a long time(especially during the first run), 
if you don't want to keep your console open or think it might run longer than 
you have your computer open run 
bitbake <<target-name>> >> logfile 2>&1 &
bitbake core-image-minimal >> /home/yocto/logfile.log 2>&1 &
