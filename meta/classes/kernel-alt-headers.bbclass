#
# Provide alternate uapi headers from a kernel, for use by
# a recipe. This is *not* a replacement for the linux-libc-headers
# package, but is expected to be used when a package is tightly
# coupled to a specific kernel and needs definitions / interfaces
# specific to that kernel.
#
# The class works in one of two ways, it can be included by the
# recipe that requires the headers (mode 1 below) or by a kernel
# recipe that provides the alternate headers. Both are valid,
# and one may be chosen over the other depending on how many
# packages need custom headers, etc.
#
# It is up to the package that builds against these headers to
# ensure that the alternate kernel headers are in the include
# path and used for the build.
#
# mode 1: included directly from a recipe that needs alternate
#         kernel headers. In this mode the headers install from
#         the shared kernel dir to WORKDIR.
#         Note: in this mode, the kernel doesn't (or shouldn't)
#               inherit kernel-alt-headers itself.
#
#         The headers will be in: $WORKDIR/usr/alt-headers
#
# mode 2: included by a kernel recipe to provide alt-headers.
#         In this mode, the kernel build/install is modified to
#         stage the headers to the sysroot (and create a
#         kernel-headers-alt package).
#
#         The headers are found in: recipe-sysroot/usr/alt-headers
#
